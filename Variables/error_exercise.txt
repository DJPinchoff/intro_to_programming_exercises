NameError: undefined local variable or method `shoes' for main:Object
  from (irb):3
  from /usr/local/rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-rc2/bin/irb:16:in `<main>'
  
ANSWER:
  The error says that you are trying to access the value of a variable or
  method called 'shoes' which doesn't exist in your current scope of code. 
  Perhaps you created the 'shoes' variable in a method and are trying to
  access it outside of the method?!?
