7. What does the following error message tell you?

SyntaxError: (irb):2: syntax error, unexpected ')', expecting '}'
from /usr/local/rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-rc2/bin/irb:16:in `<main>'

ANSWER:
It means that while I was using irb trying to figure out how to code a hash,
I kept on making the mistake of closing it with a prenthesis instead of a bracket.
