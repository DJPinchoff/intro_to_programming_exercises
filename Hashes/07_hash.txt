x = "hi there"
my_hash = {x: "some value"}
my_hash2 = {x => "some value"}

The difference between these is:

1) The code on Line 2 creates a symbol :x which is the key to the string value.
2) The code on Line 3 references the variable x which point to a string "hi there" that is now the key to the string value.
